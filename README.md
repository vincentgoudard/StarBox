# StarBox
a music box with real stars in it

Starbox is little app I originaly made to lull kids while parents can learn about stars and constellations. Actually, the exact opposite is happening and parents get asleep in no time. Even better with a beamer.

Actual star distance and brightness taken from the great Stellarium app.
