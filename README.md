# StarBox
a music box with real stars in it

Starbox is little app I originaly made with Max to lull kids while parents can learn about stars and constellations. 
Actually, the exact opposite is happening and parents get asleep in no time. 
Even better with a beamer.

Actual star distance and brightness taken from the great [Stellarium app](http://www.stellarium.org).
You will need to get [fluidsynth](http://imtr.ircam.fr/imtr/FluidSynth_for_Max/MSP).
